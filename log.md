# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3, 2020

//Writing this diary in english to improve my skills in this language.  

**Today's Progress**: Started a new challenge in front-end area to clean and increase a HTML/CSS/Javascript code. Learned and used a lot of things about html structure and how to stylize a span checkbox.   

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with the checkbox style, i want to change the input, and i don't know if it is possible. So i had to go back to the beggining with checkbox cause i don't really know if the span tag can have a value that's possible for javascript read.

### Day 1: January 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I was studying acessibility and security of HTML code, later i fix and improve the code of the challenge i'm working on. Now it has a stylized checkbox, the buttons are positioned corretcly, and i added some hover effects. From now on, I just have to adjust some little things and go to the javascript part. 

**Thoughts**: I'm using a image in the header that was driving me crazy, it creates a very ugly effect in the borders and i lost hours trying to fix in the code, BUT IT WASN'T IN THE CODE, IT WAS IN THE IMAGE, OH MY GOD. Tomorrow i'm gonna see if i can use a SVG on place.

### Day 2: January 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: After i study more of code structure, i found out about the world of code formatters on web, which is amazing! My codes are very beautiful now. The buttons in the challenge are now on, thanks to javascript. From yesterday, i didn't get de images in SVG so i used the PNG. Basically today i learned how to resolve errors.  

**Thoughts**: It's very gratifying to see a code that you're stuck for hours working after so many errors.

### Day 3: January 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today i resolve visual bugs in the challenge, i spent the day studying javascript, now i understand things such as scope and variables let/const. From javascript, i'm stuck in the logic part, but i bilieve i can solve that, when i'm not mentally tired. 

**Thoughts**: Logic is hard.

### Day 4: January 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today i finished the challenge i was working in the last days, i'm very glad with that but i have a long jorney ahead. With this work, i learn much things such as structure, acessibility and very others concecpts in the front-end area.

### Day 6: January 9, 2020

Also i finished a version 1.0 of a cool website called 'Sounds' which is very useless, buuut plays rain sound and very other sounds that has in the interface, so is that. Is not called 'nature sounds' anymore, cause i get trouble with that and i had to delete the original repository.
