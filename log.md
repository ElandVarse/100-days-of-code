# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3, 2020

//Writing this diary in english to improve my skills in this language.  

**Today's Progress**: Started a new challenge in front-end area to clean and increase a HTML/CSS/Javascript code. Learned and used a lot of things about html structure and how to stylize a span checkbox.   

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with the checkbox style, i want to change the input, and i don't know if it is possible. So i had to go back to the beggining with checkbox cause i don't really know if the span tag can have a value that's possible for javascript read.

### Day 1: January 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I was studying acessibility and security of HTML code, later i fix and improve the code of the challenge i'm working on. Now it has a stylized checkbox, the buttons are positioned corretcly, and i added some hover effects. From now on, I just have to adjust some little things and go to the javascript part. 

**Thoughts**: I'm using a image in the header that was driving me crazy, it creates a very ugly effect in the borders and i lost hours trying to fix in the code, BUT IT WASN'T IN THE CODE, IT WAS IN THE IMAGE, OH MY GOD. Tomorrow i'm gonna see if i can use a SVG on place.

### Day 2: January 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: After i study more of code structure, i found out about the world of code formatters on web, which is amazing! My codes are very beautiful now. The buttons in the challenge are now on, thanks to javascript. From yesterday, i didn't get de images in SVG so i used the PNG. Basically today i learned how to resolve errors.  

**Thoughts**: It's very gratifying to see a code that you're stuck for hours working after so many errors.

### Day 3: January 6, 2020

### Day 81: March 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today i learned about routes and SQLite while tried to fix bugs in my codes.


### Day 82: March 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I got a lot of bugs today working in my back-end, i was using insomnia, node and SQLite. I'll have to say for you guys, sometimes when i get myself in front to a hideous bug in my codes, i start to think something like: 'Oh man, i have to give up, there's no solution for this'. When this happens, i stop what i'm doing for a while and come back later. When i'm back, i usually manage to fix what is giving me trouble. What i'm saying is, if you're hopeless in some project, stop for a while, start to work in another one or even relax a little bit. Many of our problems are caused by stress and we just need to stop of think about it a bit. This works even if you to deliver a work in a time, if you relax for maybe i don't know 10 minutes, it's already good enough to rest your brain and save you some time. Living and learning.

### Day 83: March 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: The only good part of dealing with a bug, it is that you are forced to understand what your code do, note that i didn't say 'understand what you are doing', 85% of the bugs i fixed, i had no idea what i did. God bless the stack overflow. Today i learned more about git and is still confuse for me, it's super easy to mess everything up, but i'm managing.
