# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3, 2020

//Writing this diary in english to improve my skills in the language.  

**Today's Progress**: Started a new challenge in front-end area to clean and increase a HTML/CSS/Javascript code. Learned and used a lot of things about html structure and how to stylize a span checkbox.   

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with the checkbox style, i want to change the input, and i don't know if it is possible. So i had to go back to the beggining with checkbox cause i don't really know if the span tag can have a value that's possible for javascript read.

### Day 1: January 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I was studying acessibility and security of HTML code, later i fix and improve the code of the challenge i'm working on. Now it has a stylized checkbox, the buttons are positioned corretcly, and i added some hover effects. From now on, I just have to adjust some little things and go to the javascript part. 

**Thoughts**: I'm using a image in the header that was driving me crazy, it creates a very ugly effect in the borders and i lost hours trying to fix in the code, BUT IT WASN'T IN THE CODE, IT WAS IN THE IMAGE, OH MY GOD. Tomorrow i'm gonna see if i can use a SVG on place.

### Day 2: January 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: After i study more of code structure, i found out about the world of code formatters on web, which is amazing! My codes are very beautiful now. The buttons in the challenge are now on, thanks to javascript. From yesterday, i didn't get de images in SVG so i used the PNG. Basically today i learned how to resolve errors.  

**Thoughts**: It's very gratifying to see a code that you're stuck for hours working after so many errors.

### Day 3: January 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today i resolve visual bugs in the challenge, i spent the day studying javascript, now i understand things such as scope and variables let/const. From javascript, i'm stuck in the logic part, but i bilieve i can solve that, when i'm not mentally tired. 

**Thoughts**: Logic is hard.

### Day 4: January 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today i finished the challenge i was working in the last days, i'm very glad with that but i have a long jorney ahead. With this work, i learn much things such as structure, acessibility and very others concecpts in the front-end area.

**Thoughts**: Now i'm fighting a battle agaisnt javascript-es6, which is messing with my head. I hope learn responsive design  through the next days.

### Day 6: January 9, 2020


**Today's Progress**: Today i was practicing what i learn previously, doing array operations and arrow functions in javascript. I'm trying to figure out now what i'm going to do with this language cause there's so many things to learn and so very challenges to confront.

**Thoughts:** I am confused and probably lost.

### Day 7: January 10, 2020


**Today's Progress**:  I spent the day trying to make a code works, it has to show the results of a compound interest calculator, but in another page, it is harder than i thought. But the good news is that i learn how to use axios to call an api. 

**Thoughts:** I have no idea where to go now.

### Day 8: January 11, 2020


**Today's Progress**: Today was a very productive day, i updated the challenge i'm working, and IT'S WORKING, well not so perfect how a software genius could it write, but is still a thing, at least for me. I end the day learning about destructuring in javascript.

**Thoughts:** I'm happy :)

### Day 9: January 12, 2020


**Today's Progress**: I spent the day learning about responsive design in css, i think that have easier ways to do it; with frameworks or something like that, i saw only articles about css, i will deepen later in that. Well, i finished the 1st version of the calculator challenge and need to learn more about the Github and i think that's all. 

**Thoughts:** I think i hate responsive design lol
