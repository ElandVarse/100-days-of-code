# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3, 2020

//Writing this diary in english to improve my skills in the language.  

**Today's Progress**: Started a new challenge in front-end area to clean and increase a HTML/CSS/Javascript code. Learned and used a lot of things about html structure and how to stylize a span checkbox.   

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with the checkbox style, i want to change the input, and i don't know if it is possible. So i had to go back to the beggining with checkbox cause i don't really know if the span tag can have a value that's possible for javascript read.

### Day 1: January 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I was studying the acessibility and security of HTML code, later i fix and improve the code of the challenge i'm working on. Now it has a stylized checkbox, the buttons are positioned corretcly, and i added some hover effects. From now on, I just have to adjust some little things and go to the javascript part. 

**Thoughts**: I'm using a image in the header that was driving me crazy, it creates a very ugly effect in the borders and i lost hours trying to fix in the code, BUT IT WASN'T IN THE CODE, IT WAS IN THE IMAGE, OH MY GOD. Tomorrow i'm gonna see if i can use a SVG on place.
